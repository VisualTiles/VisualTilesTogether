# Visual Tiles Together

**Visual Tiles Together** turns your mobile phone or tablet into a VJ platform to allow realtime visual performance.

A **User** can add "Visual Tiles" to the main tile canvas. Each visual tile can have a drawn graphic and can have effects assigned to them by the **Moderator** (VJ). The app can then be put into **Presenter Mode** and display the main canvas and its tiles and tile effects. The **presenter** listens for updates to tiles (swapping tile images with new ones) and changes to the tiles' colors and effects.

**Users** can use the app to join the event and create visual tiles, drawing and sharing creations of their own for everyone at the event to see. The tiles they create are added to a queue from which the **Moderator** user can select and add to the main visual canvas.

This app was built as a final project for [Android Mobile Bootcamp](https://codepath.com/androidbootcamp) at Facebook in late 2016. It is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.javierarboleda.visualtilestogether)
