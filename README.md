# Visual Tiles Together

**Visual Tiles Together** turns your mobile phone or tablet into a VJ platform to allow realtime visual performance.

A user can add "Visual Tiles" to the main tile canvas. Each visual tile can have a simple drawn graphic and can have saved transformations. The program will have a process running which can fire events, and each tile can listen for events and start a transformation when an event is fired. The process can run according to a tempo (such as beats per minute) which can be entered or calculated by tapping on the screen. This can allow syncing of events with the beat of music played at the event, if desired.

Another feature allows users at the same event to log in and create a visual tile, allowing them to draw and share a creation of their own for everyone at the event to see. The tile they create will be added to a queue from which the moderator user can select and add to the main visual canvas.
